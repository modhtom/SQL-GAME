    <h1>The Riddle of the Retaliant Reporter</h1>
    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>Months after you solved the disappearance of Isabella Hawthorne, a new tragedy strikes Elderwood. Frank Miller, a reporter who was instrumental in uncovering the truth, has been found murdered in his office. He was known for his sharp instincts and was rumored to be working on a story that would once again rock the Hawthorne family.</p>
    <h1>Storyline</h1>
    <p>Frank's death seems too coincidental. Was he silenced by someone seeking revenge, or did he unearth a conspiracy that led to his demise? The crime scene is littered with cluesâ€”phone records, office logs, and drafts of his final article. It's up to you to query the new database and find the killer before they can cover their tracks for good.</p>

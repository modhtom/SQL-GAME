In the quiet town of Elderwood, the wealthy Hawthorne family's heiress, Isabella, has vanished during her 21st birthday party. As the investigator, you must query guest interviews, financial records, and security footage to uncover the truth behind her mysterious disappearance.

### Case 2: The Riddle of the Retaliant Reporter
